# Sitter City: Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
Sitter City is a premium, modern, and trustworthy online platform designed to seamlessly connect busy professionals and travellers in London with an exclusive community of elite, professionally vetted, self-employed nannies. Our core value proposition is to provide peace of mind through reliability, safety, and convenience.

## 2. The Problem
Busy professionals, affluent families, and high-end tourists in London face a significant challenge in finding trustworthy, highly-qualified, and immediately available childcare. Traditional methods are time-consuming, and generic platforms often lack the rigorous vetting and premium quality of service that a discerning clientele expects, creating uncertainty and safety concerns.

## 3. The Solution
Sitter City solves this problem by providing an exclusive, high-end marketplace focused on quality and trust. Key features include:
- **Elite Vetting:** A rigorous, multi-stage vetting process for all nannies, including background checks and in-person interviews.
- **Seamless Booking:** An intuitive platform for finding, booking, and communicating with nannies, designed for both last-minute and scheduled needs.
- **Secure Cashless Payments:** All bookings and payments are handled securely and conveniently through the platform.
- **Dedicated Dashboards:** Personalized dashboards for both parents and nannies to manage their schedules, bookings, and payments.

## 4. Target Audience
- **Primary Audience:** Busy working professionals and affluent families residing in London who require flexible, high-quality childcare and value convenience and security.
- **Secondary Audience:** High-end tourists and travellers visiting London who need dependable childcare. We will partner with luxury hotels and travel agencies to reach this audience.
