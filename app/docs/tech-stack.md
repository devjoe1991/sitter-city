# Sitter City: Technology Stack

## Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
  - **Reasoning:** We've chosen Next.js for its high-performance server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which will ensure a fast user experience and good SEO. The App Router provides a modern, flexible routing system.
- **Language:** TypeScript
  - **Reasoning:** TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability by adding static types, which is crucial for a project involving financial transactions and sensitive data.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
  - **Reasoning:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and consistent UI development directly within the markup, avoiding the need to write custom CSS.
- **Components:** Shadcn/UI
  - **Reasoning:** Provides a set of beautifully designed, accessible, and unstyled components. We can copy them into our project and customize them completely, giving us full control without being locked into a library's opinions.
- **State Management:** Zustand
  - **Reasoning:** A simple, fast, and scalable state management solution. It uses a minimalistic API and avoids the boilerplate of more complex solutions like Redux, making it ideal for our needs.

## Backend & Database
- **Platform:** Supabase
  - **Reasoning:** Supabase is an all-in-one backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that provides a Postgres database, authentication, serverless functions, and storage out of the box. This will significantly accelerate our development timeline.
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres
  - **Reasoning:** Postgres is a powerful, reliable, and scalable open-source relational database. Supabase provides a seamless interface and powerful features like Row Level Security (RLS), which is critical for securing user data.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
  - **Reasoning:** A secure, built-in solution for managing user identities, logins, and role-based access control. It integrates perfectly with the database's Row Level Security.
- **Serverless Logic:** Supabase Edge Functions
  - **Reasoning:** For running server-side business logic, such as integrating with the Stripe API for payment processing or sending notifications, without managing a dedicated server.

## Additional Services
- **Payments:** Stripe
  - **Reasoning:** The industry leader for online payment processing. It offers robust security (PCI compliance), excellent developer APIs, and a seamless user experience for credit card transactions.
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage
  - **Reasoning:** Provides a simple and secure solution for users and nannies to upload files, such as profile pictures and vetting documents. It integrates with Supabase's permission system.

## Development & Deployment
- **Hosting:** Vercel
  - **Reasoning:** Vercel offers a best-in-class experience for deploying Next.js applications. It provides seamless CI/CD, automatic scaling, a global CDN, and preview deployments for every Git push.
- **Version Control:** Git
  - **Repository URL:** https://github.com/your-username/sitter-city.git (Please update)
- **Package Manager:** NPM
